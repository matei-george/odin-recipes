# The Odin Recipes project

This the odin-recipes 2.0 project. It focuses around 4 flavours of pizza which I really love and think pretty much everybody does.

This project is a major overhaul of the initial 1.0 odin-recipes project, which was done in about 15-20 minutes. After 2 days and a lot of work, some _div soup_ and spaghetti code in some area, I think it turned out to be alright.

Hope you enjoy it as much as I did while working on it. Have a look around, explore and give me any feedback if you want to.
