# The Odin Recipes project

So, this is basically my first of **The Odin Project** list of project, one of many to come. Even though I didn't really use CSS at all, I think I will tomorrow.

This project focuses entirely on a list of recipes, some very common and interesting to prepare and use, while others...yeah...others not so great.

## Technologies used :

Throughout this project I used the following technologies :

-  HTML
-  That's literally it, if you count for search engines, yes DuckDuckGo

## Summary

This is literally a 15-20 minute HTML project about recipes. No need for more summary.
