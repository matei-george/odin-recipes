      </ul>
      <h3>Steps to success</h3>
      <ol>
         <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease two 12-inch pizza pans.</li>
         <li>
            Make sauce: Whisk together water, tomato paste, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, sugar, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl
            until smooth. Set aside.
         </li>
         <li>
            Make crust: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute.
            Gradually add remaining flour, a little at a time, until a soft, sticky dough forms.
         </li>
         <li>
            Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Add more flour as needed. (If using
            RapidRise yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)
         </li>
         <li>Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of dough onto the prepared pizza pans.</li>
         <li>Top dough with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni.</li>
         <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate pizza pans between the top and bottom
            oven racks halfway through baking.
         </li>
         <li>Enjoy eating your pizza 🍕</li>
