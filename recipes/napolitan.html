               <h2>Directions.</h2>
               <ol class="instructions">
                  <li>
                     Dissolve salt in water, then add the yeast to the water and dissolve. Immediately add a portion of the flour to the water and
                     mix. Add the remaining flour in batches, gauging how much flour is enough.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Knead for a minimum of 15-20 minutes, but ideally, 30 minutes - the dough is of ideal consistency when it's a bit sticky on the
                     hands, and on the sides of a bowl, you're mixing it in.
                  </li>
                  <li>Shape it into a ball, then lightly coat with flour, to prevent losing moisture as it rises.</li>
                  <li>Place the dough in a large bowl, then cover it with a cloth and store it in a warm place for two hours.</li>
                  <li>
                     After two hours have passed, shape the dough into balls weighing either 200 or 280 grams (7-10 oz), depending on the size of the
                     pizza you're making — a 22-24 cm (8.6-9.4-inch) or a 28-35 cm (11-13.5-inch) one.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Once you've shaped the balls, place them all on a plate and cover them with a damp cloth and let them prove for a minimum of six
                     hours.
                  </li>
                  <li>Once at least six hours have passed, take a ball of dough, place it on a lightly floured surface.</li>
                  <li>
                     Pressing on the ball of dough with the thumbs of your fingers, starting from the center and going towards the edges, shape into a
                     disc, turning the dough several times in the process.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     As a result of this action, you should end up with a disc that has about a 1-2 cm (1/2-inch) raised rim with a center that should
                     be approximately 0.3 cm (1/8-inch) thick.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Arrange the topping (the listed amounts are for a single pizza) as follows; First, place the crushed, peeled tomatoes in the
                     center of the pizza, then spread them with a spoon all over, except the rim, in a spiraling fashion.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Next, scatter the mozzarella or fior di latte evenly over the surface, followed by a sprinkling of hard grated cheese, if you're
                     using it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Place a few basil leaves on top, and to finish, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, which should be applied in a circular
                     motion, starting from the center outwards.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Place the pizza on a pizza peel and then slide it into a wood-fired oven with a quick wrist motion, so the topping stays in
                     place.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Bake for 60-90 seconds in a wood-fired oven at a temperature of about 485°C/905°F, checking the doneness by carefully lifting the
                     edges of the pizza.
                  </li>
                  <li>Also, the pizza should be rotated as it bakes but kept in the same cooking area, so every part gets baked evenly.</li>
