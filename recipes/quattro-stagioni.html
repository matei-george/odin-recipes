               <h2>Directions.</h2>
               <ol class="instructions">
                  <li>
                     Add the yeast to the lukewarm water with ½ teaspoon sugar for 5 minutes. Combine the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Make
                     a well in the centre and add the water/yeast mixture whilst mixing the dough together with a spoon until you have obtained a
                     dough. If it's too sticky you can gradually add a little more flour.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Dust a clean work surface with a little flour and knead the dough for around 5-10 minutes until it's silky smooth and soft. If
                     you lightly press your finger on the ball of dough it should spring back up easily. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to a large
                     clean bowl and rub all over until the bowl is coated. Shape the dough into a ball and place in the bowl, rub the top of the dough
                     with a tiny amount of olive oil. Cover with cling film and leave in a warm place for at least 3 hours until doubled in size.
                  </li>
                  <li>When you are ready to make the pizzas place your pizza trays in the oven and preheat the oven to 220°C/425F/gas mark 7.</li>
                  <li>
                     Divide your dough in half roughly with your hands and place on a lightly floured work surface. Press lightly in the dough to
                     shape it into a rough circle or rectangle then using a rolling pin dusted with flour roll the dough out to fit your tray. The
                     dough should be rolled out as thin as possible without tearing.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Remove the pizza tray from the oven and dust lightly with semolina flour. Transfer your dough to the tray and spread with 3
                     tablespoon of passata, you don't want to much or your pizza will go soggy. Tear up half the mozzarella with your hands and dot it
                     over the base.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Finally, add your toppings over four sections of the pizza. Repeat with the second pizza and bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes
                     until the cheese has melted and the crust is crispy.
                  </li>
                  <li>Once baked, serve immediately.</li>
